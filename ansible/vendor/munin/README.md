# Ansible Role: Munin

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/ansible-role-munin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/ansible-role-munin)

Installs munin, a monitoring system, on RedHat/CentOS or Debian/Ubuntu Linux servers.

## Requirements

If you are running a RedHat-based distribution, you need to install the EPEL repository.

If you would like to view munin's graphs and output via HTTP, you will need an HTTP server like Apache or Nginx running.

## Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with default values (see `defaults/main.yml`):

    munin_dbdir: /var/lib/munin
    munin_htmldir: /var/www/html/munin
    munin_logdir: /var/log/munin
    munin_rundir: /var/run/munin
    munin_includedir: /etc/munin/conf.d

Some default locations for Munin-generated files, configurations, logs, etc.

    munin_html_strategy: cron
    munin_max_processes: 12

See the official Munin documentation for [munin.conf](http://munin.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/munin.conf.html) for more information on these and other optional directives.

    munin_cron_job: present

Determines whether the munin cron job (which runs every 5 minutes) should be active. By setting this to `absent`, you can leave munin installed and configured on your server but effectively disable it. This allows quick enabling or disabling for munin monitoring.

    munin_admin_user: munin
    munin_admin_password: munin

These values will be used to generate a user via htpasswd under which the munin pages will be password protected with basic HTTP authentication. (*Note*: This method only works when Munin is running under default Apache configurations; if you use Nginx or a customized Apache server, you will need to configure authentication on your own).

    munin_hosts:
      - {
        name: "localhost",
        address: "127.0.0.1",
        extra: ["use_node_name yes"]
      }

A listing of hosts to which munin will connect and monitor. Each item in the list will be added to your munin configuration like the following (assuming you're using the above example):

    [localhost]
      address: 127.0.0.1
      use_node_name yes

See documentation for [Munin Node Definitions](http://munin.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/munin.conf.html#node-definitions) for more details as to what values to use here.

You can enable mail alerts by adding :

    munin_alerts:
      - {
        name: "JohnDoe",
        email: "johndoe@example.com",
        subject: "Munin-notification for ${var:group} :: ${var:host}",
        level: "warning critical"
      }

You can enable Slack alerts by adding

    munin_slack_token: xoxp-SLACK-TOKEN

Slack alerts can optionally be customised with the following variables:

    munin_slack_channel: "#munin-alerts"
    munin_slack_username: "Munin Alert Bot"
    munin_slack_emoji: ":munin:"
    munin_slack_always_alert: True
    munin_slack_alert: "ALERT <!here>"
    munin_slack_url: "http://localhost/munin/"


## Dependencies
